# The automation

To run the automation you will use the previous builded model and the game needs to be running

You will need to create your capabilities file to configure driver options

`touch automation/capabilities.py`

In the file you will need to put your configs like this:

```py
capabilities = {
    'platformName': 'iOS',
    'deviceName': '<device name>',
    'platformVersion': '<ios versions>',
    "automationName": "XCUITest",
    'udid': '<Your device id>',
    # 'app': apk_path
}
```

Tip: to see simulators list use the following command

`xcrun simctl list`

After this you will need to run the appium server for comunicate the device with automation

`./start-appium.sh`

Finally you can run the automation using the following command
