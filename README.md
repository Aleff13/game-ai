# The Game

To set up the game, you will need to access the `basic/` directory and install some modules:

1. `cd basic/`
2. `npm install`
 
â€¢ Install Cocoapods

3. `cd /ios`
4. `bundle install`

Start your ios simulator
    
7. `npx react-native run-ios`

# The model

The model generator is located inside the model/ directory. You need to train, compile, fit, and save the model. These steps are encapsulated within packages and can be called using the generate-model command. Follow these steps:

`/generate-model.sh`

Choose a name for your model.

# The automation

To run the automation, you will use the previously built model, and the game needs to be running. Follow these steps:

`touch automation/capabilities.py`

In the file you will need to put your configs like this:

```py
capabilities = {
    'platformName': 'iOS',
    'deviceName': '<device name>',
    'platformVersion': '<ios versions>',
    "automationName": "XCUITest",
    'udid': '<Your device id>',
    # 'app': apk_path
}
```

Tip: to see simulators list use the following command

`xcrun simctl list`

After this you will need to run the appium server for comunicate the device with automation

`./start-appium.sh`

Finally you can run the automation using the following command

`./run-automation.sh`
